= Generative AI Command-Line Tool

This is a Python command-line tool for generative AI. It generates output based on given input prompts, templates, and AI models. The tool supports loading prompts from files or standard input and can use specified or default paths to locate models and templates.

== Prerequisites

To use this tool, you need `Python 3.9+` installed on your system.

== Installation

1. Install `pipx` per https://github.com/pypa/pipx[The Official PipX instructions].
2. Install the wheel file using `pipx`:
+
```bash
pipx install *.whl
```

== Usage

For full and up to date usage instructions, run `ggen --help`.

As an overview, the following options are supported:

```bash
ggen [options] [prompt]

- `[options]` include:
  - `--config-file` or `-c`: Path to a JSON configuration file.
  - `--debug`: Enable debug logging for detailed output.
  - `--input` or `-i`: Path to a file containing the prompt.
  - `--output` or `-o`: Path to the output file where the result will be saved.
  - `--model-name` or `-m`: Name of the model to be used for generation.
  - `--model-path` or `-M`: Direct path to the directory containing the AI model.
  - `--schema-name` or `-s`: Name of the schema file to be used.
  - `--schema-path` or `-S`: Direct path to the directory containing the schema file.
  - `--prompt-template` or `-t`: Name of the prompt template file.
  - `--prompt-template-path` or `-T`: Direct path to the directory containing prompt templates.

- `[prompt]` is the direct input prompt.
```

== Configuration

The tool uses a `Config` class to manage configuration. You can load configuration from JSON files and override it with command-line arguments.

== Resources

This tool uses standard directories and importlib.resources to access resources such as models, schemas, and prompt templates. You can configure these paths in the `Config` class or provide them as command-line arguments.

== Generating Output

The tool generates output using a generative AI model and a grammar defined in a schema. The generated result can be saved to an output file or printed to standard output.

== Example

Here's an example of how to use the tool:

```bash
python generative_ai.py -c config.json -i input.txt -o output.json
```

This command loads configuration from `config.json`, reads the input prompt from `input.txt`, and saves the generated output to `output.json`.
